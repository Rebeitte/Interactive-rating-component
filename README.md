## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

For this challenge I practice how to iterate trought an array of elements, in this case trying to give styles to each button when the event 'click' happens, for this task I used the for loop to iterate. 

### Continued development

For my next challenge I'd like to try methods and functions that give me a clear way to iterate trought elements, like forEach or Map
